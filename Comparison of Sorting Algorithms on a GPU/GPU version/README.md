# Comparison of Parallel Sorting Algorithms on a GPU using Nvidia CUDA
## Course Code: CO332
## Course Project

### About

This project involves comparing parallel sorting algorithms on a GPU and measuring their performance on the parameters of time and 
memory bandwidth.  
The algorithms executed on the Tesla K40m Nvidia GPU are:  
* Bitonic Sort
* CUDPP Radix Sort
* Satish Merge Sort
* Satish Radix Sort
* Quick Sort
* Sample Sort

Algorithms for scan and reduction have also been implemented since they are frequently used during sorting.

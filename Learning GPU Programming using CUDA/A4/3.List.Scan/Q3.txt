1) - String comparison and lexical analysis
   - Solving recurrences and tree operations
   - Sparse matrices, histograms
   
2) 2*(log BLOCK_SIZE) Floating operations are being performed.

3) 2 Global reads.

4) 2 Global Writes.

5) Avg = Min= Max. i.e. Each thread has to perform 2*log(BLOCK_SIZE) operations.

7)Use of shared memory to optimize the performance.

8) Hillis Steele scan(a step efficient algorithm) can be used to obtain more efficient step complexity (O(logn)).

9) If input is very large then break it into several parts and the compute an intermediate
   scan for each of the part then perform scan on intermediate scan generated.

10) Commutativity is not necessary.

11) No

1) - Used while performing a work-efficient scan algorithm
   - Sorting algorithms such as radix sort
   - Polynomial evaluation
   
2) Yes, in the following line:

	thrust::device_vector<float> deviceInput(hostInput,hostInput+inputLength);
	
3) First, check out the documentation for thrust::reduce
   Understand the algorithm that has been used for reduction and check if there are any assumptions about the input characteristics
   (like size, datatype, etc.)
   Finally, incorporate the necessary changes based on the above learning

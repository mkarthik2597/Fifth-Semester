a) 
1. to build faster algorithms for polynomial interpolation
2. to construct grey codes
3. to emulate parallel algorithms that assume the ability for multiple processors to access the same
   memory cell at the same time, on parallel machines that forbid simultaneous access.
   
b)As long as the binary operator is associative, we can use parallel scan.Commutativity is not a
mandatory property.

c)It is possible that the output in serial and parallel versiuons of reductions vary. If threads in
parallel code are not synchronized, it will lead to race condition making the output different from
expected. To avoid this, One should use Atomics or __syncThreads().

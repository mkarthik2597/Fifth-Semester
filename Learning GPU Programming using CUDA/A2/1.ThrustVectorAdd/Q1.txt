Let the no. of elements in the vectors be n

1) n addition operations are being performed 
2) 2n global memory reads are being performed
3) n global memory writes are performed
4) Thrust made implementation of CUDA vector addition because:
   - High similarity to C++ STL
   - Provides a high level abstraction in that it hides the memory allocation (cudaMalloc)
     and memory copy (cudaMemcpy) from the programmer, thus simplifying his work
   - Provides inbuilt function for most of the common operations. Programmers can use these
     APIs to save time in CUDA programming and write efficient CUDA programs at the same time

1) Each thread performs atleast 1 (to load the corresponding element into shared memory) and atmost 4 global memory reads (The other three global memory 
   reads is for the corner elements)
  
2) Each thread performs atleast 3 (in the case of corner elements) and atmost 6 shared memory reads (for those well within the shared memory)

4) The minimum dimensions for a 3D mask is (3,3,3). The number of floating point operations each thread will perform will be approximately 27,
   which is much higher than the 7 floating point operations performed by each thread for a stencil.

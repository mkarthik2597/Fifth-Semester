1) Yes, in the following line:

  thrust::device_vector<unsigned int> deviceInput(hostInput,hostInput+inputLength);

2) Sorting: O(nlogn)
   Cumulative histogram (Essentially does binary search for every elemnt):  O(n*logn)
   Adjacent difference: O(n)
   
   Total: O(nlogn)
   
3) O(n) for read, updation in private histogram and write on the global histogram

4) Histogram sort is done when the number of histogram bins is larger than the size of input data. 
   For eg, in the given question, the number of bins is 128, but the data size is only 11.

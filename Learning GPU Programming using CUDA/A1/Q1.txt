1) Architecture: Tesla K40m
   Compute capability: 3.5
   
2) Maximum block dimension:(1024,1024,64)
   Maximum threads per block=1024

3) Maximum number of threads that can be launched=65535*512=33,553,920 threads

4) The number of threads that should be spawned in the kernel depends upon the size of the data that the threads operate on.
   For e.g., addition of 2 1-dimensional arrays, each containing 4 elements requires only 4 threads. Each thread will perform one addition operation.
   The remaining threads which are spawned do not execute the kernel code. Also, thread creation and termination will consume some time,
   causing unnecessary performance losses
	   
5) The number of threads that can be launched depends on the number of resources used by each thread. SMs have finite resources of threads and
   local memory. If the amount of resources used per thread is high, we may not be able to hit the theoretical maximum no. of threads.

6) Shared memory is the memory allocated per thread block, so all threads in a block have access to the same shared memory.
   Shared Memory per block: 49152 bytes
   
7) Global memory refers to the total amount of DRAM on the GPU. On Tesla K40, it is approximately 12GB

8) Constant memory on a CUDA device stores read only data. On this device, amount of constant memory is 65536 bytes

9) The warp size is the number of threads running concurrently on a streaming multiprocessor (SM). The warp size is 32.

10) Yes, Tesla K40 supports double precision.
